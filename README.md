_:warning: Do not use in production, see [Why?](#why) :warning:_

A dead simple nginx based proxy cache for [aws ec2 instance metadata service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html).

Unfortunately IMDS is a [rate limited service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html#instancedata-throttling), which fortunately is relatively
safe to cache.

## Why?

[We at TIDAL](/tidal-engineering) were running some issues on our Jenkins builds
that heavily rely on terraform.

During normal aws-cli usage (in this case ecr login):

```
Error when retrieving credentials from Ec2InstanceMetadata: No credentials found in credential_source referenced in profile XXX
``` 

But also with terraform:

```
Error: No valid credential sources found for AWS Provider.
Please see https://terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html for more information on
providing credentials for the AWS Provider
```

These issues were intermittent, happened at random places, and a re-run would
usually solve the issue.

Our Jenkins-nodes are DinD (per build) on EC2 and we rely on `Ec2InstanceMetadata`
as `credential_source`.

We were able to pinpoint the issue on thousands of IMDS requests being run in a
short period of time.

An issue has been created upstream, but it will most probably not be fixed:
[hashicorp/terraform/issues/25835](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/25835#issuecomment-674299327).

## Usage

Run on the host:

```bash
$ sudo useradd -u 65321 -m -d /var/lib/proxy_user -s /sbin/nologin proxy_user
$ docker pull --quiet lifeofguenter/ec2metadata-proxycache:latest
$ docker run \
  -d \
  -m 128m \
  -u 65321 \
  -p "127.0.0.1:12345:8080" \
  --restart always \
  --name ec2metadata-proxycache \
  lifeofguenter/ec2metadata-proxycache:latest
```

Optionally if you are running dockerd on that host, add the following arg:

```bash
-p "$(ip -4 addr show docker0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+'):12345:8080"
```

On the host itself, run the following to forward all IMDS requests to the proxy:

```bash
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -m owner ! --uid-owner proxy_user -d 169.254.169.254 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:12345
```

Inside containers, run the following to forward all IMDS requests to the proxy:

```bash
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 169.254.169.254 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination "$(ip route | awk '/default/ { print $3 }'):12345"
```
